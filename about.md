## Vision

Team Anveshak was set up with a vision to inspire students to work on challenging problems in space exploratory robotics. Our underlying vision has now expanded with the team aiming to not only develop an all terrain rover but also educate people on the importance of space research. In future, Team Anveshak aspires to assist various <b>Space Agencies</b>, <b>Defence Organizations</b> & <b>Ministries of the Govt. of India</b> in developing disaster management systems and deploying scientific expeditions or reconnaissance missions.

## History and Achievements

The foundations of the team were laid by the senior undergraduates and alumni of the Robotics Club under Center For Innovation, IIT Madras in 2016. The team takes great pride in it’s progress since its’ establishment with our rover “Aurora” being designed & manufactured in a short time frame of about 6 months. The team secured a position among the top 30 teams from all over the world in its debut attempt at URC 2017.
Since URC 2017, the team worked hard to design, manufacture and assemble our second version of Aurora: Aurora 2.0 ,which is a four wheeled design that inculcated an innovative steering mechanism and a novel robotic manipulator mechanism that sports a payload of more than 6 kgs. The team qualified for the competition after presenting the SAR Report in March 2018 and we participated in URC 2018 as one of the 4 teams from India. The team’s performance improved quite significantly and we placed in the top 25 teams, outperforming some of world’s top universities as well.
The team’s performances have been capturing the attention of prominent national dailies - The Times of India, India Today- reiterating our commitment to developing world class technologies in India & pushing the boundaries of innovation.
